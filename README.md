# Language Breakdown Progress Bar in /Projects
Integrated the progress bar from [link](https://github.com/willdavsmith/react-github-languages)
Originally installed via "npm install", however source code had not implemented support for the C++ language.
Thus I copied the source code into the gh.js file and added the support for it myself, this also allowed me to change the fontsize of the texts.
